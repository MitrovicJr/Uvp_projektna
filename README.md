The repository contains the project for my course 'Uvod v Programiranje'.
In the repository there is a python document, which contains the program for the web-scraping part of the project. The results of this project are stored in the 'results' folder, which contains a csv file.
Additionally, there is a Jupyter notebook which uses the data from the csv file and contains the data visualization and analysis for the project.
